## WEAXAN

Newbie's tutorial to Build an Action RPG Game "WEAXAN" in Godot.
It's for the Newbie, by the Newbie.

* [Session.1 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92jRXkCU0UQ)

We'll build a simple 2D game from scratch, using Godot Engine. It's by the Newbie, for the Newbie Godot Tutorial. 

It'll be an Action RPG style game, with a top-down view. We'll cover the basics of Godot.

> I'm very new to building with Godot myself, so if any step seems sub-optimal or straight-up wrong.. let me know in the comments, I'll look into it.
